NAME
----
nng_inproc - intra-process transport for nng

SYNOPSIS
--------

[source,c]
----------
#include <nng/transport/inproc/inproc.h>

int nng_inproc_register(void);
----------

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The _nng_inproc_ transport provides communication support between
_nng_ sockets within the same process. This may be used as an alternative
to slower transports when data must be moved within the same process.

This transport tries hard to avoid copying data, and thus is very
light-weight.

Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The _inproc_ transport is generally built-in to the _nng_ core, so
no extra steps to use it should be necessary.

URI Format
~~~~~~~~~~

This transport uses URIs using the scheme `inproc://`, followed by
an arbitrary string of text, terminated by a `NUL` byte.

Multiple URIs can be used within the
same application, and they will not interfere with one another.

Two applications may also use the same URI without interfering with each
other, and they will be unable to communicate with each other using
that URI.

Socket Address
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using an `nng_sockaddr` structure, the actual structure is of type
`struct nng_sockaddr_inproc`.  This type has the following definition:

[source,c]
--------
#define NNG_AF_INPROC 1 <1>
#define NNG_MAXADDRLEN 128

typedef nng_sockaddr_inproc {
    // <2>
    uint16_t sa_family;                  // must be NNG_AF_INPROC
    char     sa_path[NNG_MAXADDRLEN];    // arbitrary "path"
    //
}
--------
<1> The values of these macros may change, so applications
should avoid depending upon their values and instead use them symbolically.
<2> Other members may be present, but only those listed here
are suitable for application use.

The `sa_family` member will have the value `NNG_AF_INPROC`.
The `sa_path` member is an ASCIIZ string, and may contain any characters,
terminated by a `NUL` byte.

Transport Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The _inproc_ transport has no special options.
