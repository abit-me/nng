NAME
----
nng_tls_config_cert_key_file - load own certificate and key from file

SYNOPSIS
--------

[source, c]
-----------
#include <nng/nng.h>

int nng_tls_config_cert_key_file(nni_tls_config *cfg, const char *path,
    const char *pass);
-----------

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The `nng_tls_config_cert_key_file()` function loads a certificate (or
certificate chain) and a private key from the file named by 'path'.

The file must contain both the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7468[PEM]
encoded certificate and associated private key, which will be used when
establishing TLS sessions using 'cfg'.  It may contain additional certificates
leading to a validation chain, with the leaf certificate first.
There is no need to include the self-signed root, as the peer
will need to have that already in order to perform it's own validation.

The private key may be encrypted with a password, in which can be supplied in
'pass'.  The value NULL should be supplied for 'pass' if the key is not
encrypted.

On servers, it is possible to call this function multiple times for the
same configuration.  This can be useful for specifying different parameters
to be used for different cryptographic algorithms.


RETURN VALUES
-------------

This function returns 0 on success, and non-zero otherwise.

ERRORS
------

`NNG_ENOMEM`:: Insufficient memory is available.
`NNG_EBUSY`:: The configuration 'cfg' is already in use, and cannot be modified.
`NNG_EINVAL`:: The contents of 'path' are invalid.
`NNG_ENOENT`:: The file named by 'path' does not exist.
`NNG_EPERM`:: The file named by 'path' cannot be opened.
